Done watering!

If you can't play, you'll get a nice error similar to this:
RuntimeError: (403, 'Forbidden', {'default': 'Your time to play in the Pokémon DW is over for today.\\nYou can play again tomorrow.', 'is_pdw_timeout': 1})
However, you should still get your name and game info.

Planned features:
- Search for a certain player (by name, country, item put up for trade, etc.)
- Make a nice spiderweb diagram of the neighbourhood!
- Automatically water berries
- ???

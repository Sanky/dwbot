An experimental bot to automatize actions for the Pokémon Dream World.
This script is licenced under the zlib licence.  See LICENCE for details.

Throws a RuntimeError if the server returns an error.

The following does not currently apply.
Current usage:
$ python3 dwbot.py PMDSUSSID TOKEN
where PMDSUSSID is from the cookie and TOKEN is from the URL.  Look up one 
request in Wireshark to see these; they don't seem to change at all, so you 
only need to do this once (until logging in is implemented).

Current output (hopefully):
sanky@kuriputo:~/emurom/poké$ python3 dwbot.py [PMDSUSSID] [TOKEN]
 Harvestable berries: 0
 Unwatered berries: 0

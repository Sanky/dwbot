An experimental bot to automatize actions for the Pokémon Dream World.

Current usage:
$ python3 dwbot.py PMDSUSSID TOKEN
where PMDSUSSID is from the cookie and TOKEN is from the URL.  Look up one 
request in Wireshark to see these; they don't seem to change at all, so you 
only need to do this once (until logging in is implemented).

Current output (hopefully):
sanky@kuriputo:~/emurom/poké$ python3 dwbot.py
 Harvestable berries: 0
 Unwatered berries: 0
List of friends:
Abumi (Czech Republic)
Tatertot745 (United States of America)

Throws a RuntimeError if the server returns an error.
